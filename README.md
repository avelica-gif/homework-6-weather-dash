This project consisted of us creating a weather dashboard using a weather API. 

I am still struggling a lot with CSS and JavaScript (but mostly JavaScript).
I think I was overthinking  the HTML and CSS at first, trying to make it perfectly like the example giving in the homework.

I mostly used Bootstrap to get my HTML together.

I feel like I had to really clean up my HTML and CSS to make it look better, but that came with me removing a lot of things that I perhaps needed or didn't need. 

I am still struggling a lot with API's because I am still struggling a lot with JavaScript. I got a lot of internet help for this portion, but I am still having a very difficult time understanding. Even after following directions, I do not know what I am doing.

However, I am receiving a 404 error and I do not understand why that is.
